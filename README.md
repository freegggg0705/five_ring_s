###If your HTML file is named index.html, you can access it directly using the URL:


https://<your github username>.github.io/<repository name>/

If your HTML file has a different name, youâ€™ll need to include the file name in the URL to access it.
For example, if your HTML file is named hello123.html, the URL would be:
https://<your github username>.github.io/<repository name>/hello123.html
